Design Choice

unlike ennui no splash screen promt direct to dashbaord adn on toolbas have the learn 

flat colors contrast consistent and code base smaller and acessibility compliance easier

contending for side bar and open collapse to abstract out to topbar and entire side dock is selection subsectoins ennui to a degree but two side bars and icon crutch so reduce deadspace and floating palatte on the grid for stuff hover open and select stuff or side bar space hmm think about it and drag and drop to canvas prompt hover for purspose side side bar but mouse travel less so keyboard navigate simplest good and ? help on top smallest section approachable remoce and undesigns as much as you can

grid snapping make shapes a bit smaller

grid and mac clean up feature and auto that and no breaking exzess too? hmm dunno

not jsut minst loaded in but local directory as well to use it eh

figma
webflow
front end
blue palatte inviting light theme dark theme discord slack context separation
card abuse exessivly to only where neede

mouse travel side bar choice move to top and preview fast as you hover and very small set of opinionated shortcuts nice window in unofficial onvenion trigger to override mouse travel

dark mode trusted palatte dracula theme instead of remixing would be nice but if not too hoherent in light to dark transition can change to a more muted theme good contrast fundamentals

good icon packs for all 
figma variants to try out all
scrap gradient after trying it keep code base simple

centered aourn customisability but nott the ui to have option paralysis
