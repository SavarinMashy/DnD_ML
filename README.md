webflow
front end
blue palatte inviting light theme dark theme discord slack context separation
card abuse exessivly to only where neede

mouse travel side bar choice move to top and preview fast as you hover and very small set of opinionated shortcuts nice window in unofficial onvenion trigger to override mouse travel

dark mode trusted palatte dracula theme instead of remixing would be nice but if not too hoherent in light to dark transition can change to a more muted theme good contrast fundamentals

good icon packs for all 
figma variants to try out all
scrap gradient after trying it keep code base simple

centered aourn customisability but nott the ui to have option paralysis
