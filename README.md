# Drag and Drop Machine Learning Web Application

Working under Cooper Sigrist at the Biologically Inspired Neural and Dynamical Systems (BINDS) Lab at Umass Amherst.<br> <br>
DnD-ML is a highly accessible research and educational GUI tool to build your ML models.


Visit the live demo of an earlier version of the front-end for the web-app [here](https://sashiku.github.io/dnd-ml/) <br>
Visit the team-lead's repository for the most recent updates [here](https://github.com/coopersigrist/DnDML) (github.com/coopersigrist/DnDML)<br>
âœ¨  Migrating to React and Flask. <br><br>
We have graphical components for the following: <br>
- Layers: 
  - Convolution
  - Max-Pooling
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dropout
  - Dense
  - Flatten
  - Concatenate
- Activation:
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Tanh

* The user interface and drag and drop feature is _inspired_ by ENNUI - Elegant Neural Network User Interface

* The command palette feature is an attempt at replicating the utility the website www.monkeytype.com offers. Similar functionality is offered in Visual Studio Code, Obsidian.md, Chrome Dev. Tools, Figma etc...
